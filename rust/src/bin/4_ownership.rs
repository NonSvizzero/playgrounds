    Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.

    Basically there is no shallow copy for data on the heap, just moving
    bools, integers, float, char and tuples are all stored on the stack and thus get not moved

    we don't take ownership, so the referenced variable doesn't get freed when the reference gets

    We are not allowed to change values from immutable references, we need mutable references.
    However,  mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference
    to a particular piece of data in a particular scope AND you cannot have a mutable reference while
    you also have immutable ones. THIS PREVENTS DATA RACES AT COMPILE TIME:
    At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    References must always be valid.
